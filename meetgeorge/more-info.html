                In his childhood he spent six years as an Eagle Scout, making him one of the few 
                men who can boast of that distinction. His older brother was also an Eagle Scout 
                but then died in a tragic boating accident on the Potomac River when George was 
                still eight years old.

                He attended Woodrow Wilson High School where he excelled in football, baseball, 
                basketball, archery, fencing, marching band, fencing marching band, regular band, 
                theater, film, painting, graphic design, 2d animation, 3d animation, choir, show 
                choir, show and tell choir, Magic the Gathering, stage magic, literal magic and 
                track. He set national records at discus, javelin, shot put, high jump, long jump, 
                100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, 400-meter relay, 800-meter relay, mile run, mile 
                run relay, mile and a half relay, 110-meter hurdles, 300-meter hurdle relay, and 
                wizard dueling. He won state titles in all of them except for the triple jump. At 
                the end of his senior year, George was named "All State" in everything. There were 
                no national championships in any sport back then, however, so George did not 
                receive a gold medal or trophy or anything because he turned them down every time.

                in his home life, George was raised by two loving parents and no sibling (not after 
                the accident). His father was a computer programmer and his mother an accountant. 
                When he was four, George's father bought him his first computer, and from that 
                point forward he became a master hacker. It soon became clear that this early 
                interest in computers would eventually take over his life. By the age of seven, 
                he had already made himself one of the best programmers in the world. His work has 
                been used by police agencies around the globe and by numerous government 
                departments in Washington. He soon quit because government work is boring.

                In his life he has had many careers, all of them in fact. He was an actor and a writer, 
                a painter and sculptor, a dancer, a musician, a designer and an architect, a scholar 
                and a teacher, a student and a doctor. He has been a spy, a soldier, a sailor, a pilot, 
                an astronaut, a sorcerer, a wizard, a warlock, a druid, a scientist, an inventor, 
                a philosopher, a mathematician, a lawyer, a salesman, a poet, a playwright, a historian, 
                a mechanic, and a chef.

                George is currently a professor of engineering at Harvard University, where he teaches 
                courses in robotics, artificial intelligence, and pastries. One of his students is 
                working on creating a machine that will be able to think like George but every time 
                it tries the power goes out and the computer explodes. George, of course, is very 
                upset about this.
                
                Despite his many accomplishments, George is not arrogant. He does not believe he is 
                better than anybody else and never has. In fact, George believes everyone else is 
                far luckier than him, as he will never get an opportunity to meet George. If he did, 
                that would mean someone else had met George and then George would know they had and 
                then George would realize he had not met George so then he would feel bad and go 
                home and lie down.
                
                George's greatest accomplishment was learning how to walk backwards while juggling 
                three bowling pins. This feat was done by following the instructions in Chapter Three 
                of his autobiography, "How I Learned to Walk Backwards While Juggling Bowling Pins," 
                which was published in 1982. The book was printed in a limited edition of 500 copies.

                In the future he plans to create a robot that can make hot cocoa without spilling any. 
                Because that is something he wants. Also, George wishes to build a house with a cupola. 
                And a moat. Just a normal moat. Not a magical one. He already did that. He also has 
                plans to start a family. He is hoping to find a girl who can sing and draw and dance 
                and play guitar and be funny.

                He also plans to branch out into charity work as he has already become super duper 
                insanely rich. He hopes to do this by collecting enough money to buy a house big 
                enough to fit all of the homeless people in it. Then he can feed them and keep them 
                warm and he won't have to worry about them anymore.

              <h3 class="list-title">Other projects he is planning include:</h4>
                <li>Becoming President of the United States.</li>
                <li>Learning to cook again.</li>
                <li>Getting a dog.</li>

                <li>Writing a sequel to How I Learned to Walk Backwards While Juggling Bowling Pins.</li>
                <li>And finally, his biggest dream is to someday sit next to George on an airplane and not have to get up when he gets off.</li>
