    <p>Hi I'm Scott. I am in a web development class and I am required to write 
        a pragraph for this website. I am a computer science major and not because 
        I love writing paragraphs. My favorite kind of TV show is Comedy
        I like to play video games of all kinds, unless there is some game where the 
        main gameplay loop requires writing random paragraphs. I am from Moreno Vally Ca,
        and went to Canyon Springs Highschool where my real love of not writing began.
    
        ps. I actually didn't mind the assignment and only wrote the paragraph like I did was because I thought it would be funny.</p>
